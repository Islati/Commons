/**
 * This Config example shows how you can use other Objects (from Config Classes) to build up more complex
 * Configurations. In this example the Goal is to have a Location saved into a Config.
 * <p/>
 * For that we use a public inner class. This is not the best thing.
 * Normally its the best to make a seperate Package containing Config Sub classes.
 * <p/>
 * This example will use the Getter/Setter pattern for accessing the values, you can ofc use public modified
 * fields if you want to.
