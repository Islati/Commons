Commons - Everything you'll need for Bukkit
==========

During the release of Minecraft 1.5.X and having made plenty of Bukkit plugins, I always
wanted a framework that removed all the boiler-plating possible, so I could focus
more on core plugin development. I wanted an all in one library with power, flexibility, fluency,
and verbosity.. None existed, so I created *commons*.
