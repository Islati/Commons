Configurable Messages!
=================================

	Implement a message interface that loads its unformatted strings from a file; YAML? XML?

	Inspiration: https://github.com/BanManagement/BanManager/blob/master/src/main/resources/messages.yml
				 https://github.com/Frostcast/BukkitPluginUtil/blob/master/src/me/confuser/bukkitutil/Message.java


Chat Message Builder
=======================================

	Build chat messages with a builder interface 
	Like 'ChatMessage.make().text("Some Text Here").hoverableText("Some Highlight Here").onHover("This is hovered text!").text("");

Commands Module - Upgrade
=======================================

	Implement text that's hoverable for all the commands, and when clicked it adds that syntax
	into the players chat, like done in HoloDisplays!
	

Armor Command - Slot Specific Armors.
=======================================
	Add flags for individual armor pieces and accept material as params for /armor
	
	Example:

		Diamond helmet, Iron Chestplate, No pants or boots: "/armor -h diamond -c iron"

		Leather suit with diamond boots: "/armor -hcl leather -b diamond"

BlockText Command - Create a way to roll-back / undo.
=====================================================
	Design and implement a way to roll-back the placement of block-text, and assure that terrain isn't mangled in the process.


Event Clause System
=====================================================

Subscribe to events! Example:

	When (EntityDamageEvent)
		and (entity is Pig)
		then {
			EXPLODE PIG
		}
