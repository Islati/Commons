* ItemGridBuilder to put in empty rows?

GUNS & BULLETS DAMAGE OPTION
=================
Will reduce damage and accuracy over the distance the entity (bullet) has travelled.

MINIGAME ENGINE
==================
	1. Option to force respawn players (Perhaps based on predicate?)


Bonemeal Gadget / Command
=================================
Gadget / Methods that can simulate the placement of bonemeal, to form grass and things of that nature.
If I write the methods to do it I can easily create a gadget around that!


Configurable Messages!
=================================

	Implement a message interface that loads its unformatted strings from a file; YAML? XML?

	Inspiration: https://github.com/BanManagement/BanManager/blob/master/src/main/resources/messages.yml
				 https://github.com/Frostcast/BukkitPluginUtil/blob/master/src/me/confuser/bukkitutil/Message.java

Commands Module - Upgrade
=======================================

	Implement text that's hoverable for all the commands, and when clicked it adds that syntax
	into the players chat, like done in HoloDisplays!
	

Armor Command - Slot Specific Armors.
=======================================
	Add flags for individual armor pieces and accept material as params for /armor
	
	Example:

		Diamond helmet, Iron Chestplate, No pants or boots: "/armor -h diamond -c iron"

		Leather suit with diamond boots: "/armor -hcl leather -b diamond"

BlockText Command - Create a way to roll-back / undo.
=====================================================
	Design and implement a way to roll-back the placement of block-text, and assure that terrain isn't mangled in the process.


Event Clause System
=====================================================

Subscribe to events! Example:

	When (EntityDamageEvent)
		and (entity is Pig)
		then {
			EXPLODE PIG
		}
